# Stablecoins and new units of account 

Listened to a podcast (Hidden forces with Demetri Kofinas) with Charles Calomiris on stablecoins and found some aspects really intriguing: 

- The apparent slowness and backwardness of the current payments system. Seems like there are some very annoying things that a lot of people take for granted. 
- Denominating in something else than dollar. The idea that goes back at least to Jevons that a consumption bundle is perhaps a more natural, and in some way optimal unit. One could have the ´Jonatan bundle´ 
    - Still, wouldn't this just transform the needed exchange, possibly making it even more complicated, being now about exchanging with millions of different bundles that are also quite possibly time-varying, in a non-obvious way? 
    - How could I estimate such a bundle? Seems like an intersection with AI and consumer inflation indices, somehow
    - Also, why isn't there a personal inflation index for my bundle? And slightly related, who thought it made sense to remove asset inflation from such indices? 
    - The personal bundles will vary from person to person so it makes sense to get some lower fidelity aggregates, perhaps on the level of regions or economic zones, like the Stockholm bundle. An interesting theoretical question: What is the right geometry to do this aggregation in (geographical, social network and graph based...)? And given some answer to that question, a more empirical one: Can we measure economic segregation in this way? 
    - an important point here is that it is the blockchain itself that would allow one to come up with these new units of account, since all transactions are in some way public. 
- Programmable money: seems crazy that this is not already a bigger thing. 
- An interesting theoretical question: Does it make sense to aggregate deposit taking and lending? 
    - The answer seems to have been yes in the past, but now it is apparently not so clear anymore. 
    - rise of data aggregation platforms
- The topic of shadow-banking. I should probably understand better what shadow banks are.
