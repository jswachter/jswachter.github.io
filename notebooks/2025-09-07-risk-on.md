# Adverse media screening for millions of banking clients 

Large financial institutions need to understand the nature of their clients, they need to know their customer. An initial screening takes place when a prospectiver customer signs up for a bank, questionaires are filled out, interviews conducted and the result is a set of entries into the customer database, containing perhaps the origin of funds, the nature of the business, biographical information etc. It is of course possible to lie or withhold certain truths dutring this initial screening, and things can also materially change after the customer has been officially registered. One source of such information is global news. With customers from hundreds of nations all over the world, a large multinational bank is faced with hundreds of thousands of potentially relevant news articles and alerts every day. Flagging such pieces of information for relevance and reviewing them is a requirement. It is also very costly, and so the 2025 RiskON featured exactly this kind of adverse media screening as a challenge.
