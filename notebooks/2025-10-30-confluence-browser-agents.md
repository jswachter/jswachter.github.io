# Confluence of browsers, agents and apps 

There have been some new AI native browsers launches recently, most notably that of OpenAI's Atlas. There are a lot of players in this field, it's very crowded: Based on my circle of friends, real life and on LinkedIn, I'm aware of Strawberry from Stockholm, and BrowserUse from Zurich. It's arguable whether the latter is even in the same category as the first two, probably not based on the API focus, but still. Tzafon should also be mentioned in this connection. 

Atlas and whatever Google decide to counter with will have an edge in terms of distribution, but it's unclear to me if one monolithic general purpose browser/browser agent is the end state. 

BroswerUse is for now quicker on many navigation tasks, having trained their own smaller model specifically for this purpose. Strawberry claims that it can run for longer, with purpose built agents for cold outreach, finding leads etc. 

In another corner of the OpenAI ecosystem we have recently seen the launch of the Apps SDK, a kind of combined MCP and inline UI paradigm. There is a core of capabilities where the big foundation model companies, with their integrated chat bot experience have a clear edge. They domainate in integrating new features that are common to a lot of use cases, trying to build a base operating system layer. As I have written before (ahead of the recent OpenAI devday), I think many apps should live in Claude and ChatGPT, with their own custom UI, rather than as standalone platforms. 

So what does this mean for browsers? The big players in this arena should release a protocol that makes it possible to build apps (or agents if you will), that live inside of their browsers. Their navigation models should be able to hand over control to more specialized models for certain tasks. Just as I can have very useful plugins in Chrome and Safari, I want to be able to use agentic plugins in Atlas. They should be able to harness some of the general capabilities of Atlas, but be allowed to go beyond that on their specific focus areas.
