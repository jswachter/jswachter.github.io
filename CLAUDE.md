# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Repository Overview

This is a personal portfolio website hosted on GitHub Pages (jswachter.github.io). It's a simple, static HTML site showcasing Jonatan S. WÃ¤chter's academic and professional background.

## Project Structure

- `index.html` - Main portfolio page with inline CSS styling
- `images/` - Directory containing images used in the portfolio
- `pdfs/` - Directory containing PDF documents (academic papers, lecture notes)
- `README.md` - GitHub profile README

## Development Guidelines

### Styling
- All CSS is currently embedded within `index.html` using inline `<style>` tags
- The design uses a clean, minimalist approach with Helvetica font family
- Color scheme: white background, dark gray text (#333), subtle shadows

### Content Updates
When updating portfolio content:
- Education, work experience, interests, and projects sections are structured as unordered lists
- PDF links open in new tabs using `target="_blank"`
- Images use the `profile-image` class for consistent styling

### GitHub Pages Deployment
This site is deployed automatically via GitHub Pages from the main branch. Any changes pushed to main will be reflected on the live site.

### Git Commits
When creating commits, do not include any mention of Claude Code or AI assistance in commit messages.
